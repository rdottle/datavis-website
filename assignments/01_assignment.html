    </div>
      <p class="bioText"><b>Hive plots </b> are one representational and computational solution to visualizing complex networks. <b> Networks </b> generally consist of nodes, which are connected within a system by edges. Hive plots place nodes on "<a href = "https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/13/5/627/412507/Hive-plots-rational-approach-to-visualizing" >radially oriented</a>" linear axes, like a coordinate system. Unlike other network visualization techniques, hive plots project the network onto a multi-dimensional coordinate system that is based on properties of the network, like clustering or connectivity. This allows plot readers to spot patterns in the given network. 
 </p>
   <div>
      <h2 class = "subTitleleft"> <b> Why </b> a hive plot? </h2>
    </div>
        <p class="bioText"> Network visualizations are difficult to interpret, and often if the network is large, visualizations begin to resemble <a href="http://www.hiveplot.net/img/hiveplot-hairball-1.png">hairballs.</a> While visually appealing, network representations can be difficult to interpet. Visualizing networks is important, though and networks are utilized in a variety of fields to model dynamic relationships between units, or nodes. They enable the representation of systems, and those systems’ global properties. Network analysis can occur at the genome, cell, social circle, or city scale. Regardless of the size of the network, communicating its structure and modeling network behaviours can be quite difficult. </p>

        <p class="bioText"> Enter hive plots. Hive plots allow readers to understand aspects of a network’s structure. Unlike hairballs, hive plots manage visualizing large numbers of edges and nodes, structured based on network parameters of interest like connectivity. 
        </p>
     <div>
        <h2 class = "subTitle" > <b>How </b> are hive plots created? </h2>   
        <p class="bioText"> To make a hive plot, network features must first be calculated. These network features may be based in network graph theory, and could be measures of <b> clustering,</b> or <b> global </b> or <b>local connectivity.</b> These parameters are chosen based on the hive plot creator’s network pattern interests.  

        Once a network parameter is chosen, the node coordinates used in the hive plot are then based on that parameter. Unlike in a graph network representation, nodes are represented as “glyphs” and edges as “curves” between nodes.
